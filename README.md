## Installation

```sh
$ npm install lifxware --save
```

### Client

The library uses a client for network communication. This client handles communication with all lights in the network.

```js
import { Client } from 'lifxware';
const client = new Client();
```

The `Client` object is an EventEmitter and emmits events whenever any changes occur. This can be a new light discovery, a light sending a message or similar.
The client starts discovery of lights upon it's creation. If a new light is found the client emmits a `light-new` event. This event contains the light as an object on which methods can be called then:

```js
import { Client } from 'lifxware';
const client = new Client();

client.on('light-new', (light) => {
	// Change light state here
});
```

### Client settings

For the initialization of the client different settings can be provided.
This is an example with the default options:

```js
import { Client } from 'lifxware';
const client = new Client({
	lightOfflineTolerance: 3, // A light is offline if not seen for the given amount of discoveries
	messageHandlerTimeout: 45000, // in ms, if not answer in time an error is provided to get methods
	startDiscovery: true, // start discovery after initialization
	resendPacketDelay: 150, // delay between packages if light did not receive a packet (for setting methods with callback)
	resendMaxTimes: 3, // resend packages x times if light did not receive a packet (for setting methods with callback)
	debug: false, // logs all messages in console if turned on
	address: '0.0.0.0', // the IPv4 address to bind the udp connection to
	broadcast: '255.255.255.255', // set's the IPv4 broadcast address which is addressed to discover bulbs
	lights: [] // Can be used provide a list of known light IPv4 ip addresses if broadcast packets in network are not allowed
	// For example: ['192.168.0.112', '192.168.0.114'], this will then be addressed directly
});

client.on('light-new', (light) => {
	// Change light state here
});
```

### Light discovery

The discovery for each client can be started and stopped at runtime using these commands:

#### `client.startDiscovery()`

```js
try {
	await client.startDiscovery();
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}
```

Starts the discovery process.

#### `client.stopDiscovery()`

Stops the discovery process.
s

```js
try {
	await client.stopDiscovery();
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}
```

### Changing light state

The states of a light can be changed with different methods:

#### `light.setPower(power, [duration])`

This turns a light on.

| Option     | Type    | Default | Description                                                   |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `power`    | boolean | 1       | Turn on / off                                                 |
| `duration` | int     | 0       | Turning on/off will be faded over the time (in milliseconds). |

The function will return a promise.
If the light has been reached with success, the promise will be resolved, otherwise it will be rejected after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not.

Usage examples:

```js
try {
	// Turns the light on instantly
	await light.setPower(true);
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}

try {
	// Fading the light on over two seconds
	await light.setPower(true, 2000);
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}
```

#### `light.getColor([cache], [duration])`

Gets the color of a light in HSB color values. This is the preferred method to get the color of a light.

| Option     | Type | Default | Description                   |
| ---------- | ---- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `duration` | int  | 0       | Gets the current light color. |

The function will return a promise.
If the light has been reached with success, the promise will be resolved, otherwise it will be rejected after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not.

Usage examples:

```js
try {
	const data = await light.getColor();

	logger.info(data);
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}

try {
	//Cached
	const data = await light.getColor(true);

	logger.info(data);
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}
```

Example result:

```json
{
	"hue": 321,
	"saturation": 15,
	"brightness": 66,
	"kelvin": 3600
}
```

#### `light.setColor(hue, saturation, brightness, [kelvin], [duration])`

Changes the color of a light to an HSB color value. This is the preferred method to change the color of a light.

| Option       | Type | Default | Description                                                                      |
| ------------ | ---- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hue`        | int  |         | Between 0 and 360, representing the color hue in degree which changes the color. |
| `saturation` | int  |         | Between 0 and 100, representing the color intensity from 0% to 100%.             |
| `brightness` | int  |         | Between 0 and 100, representing the light brightness from 0% to 100%.            |
| `kelvin`     | int  | 3500    | Between 2500 and 9000, representing the color temperature.                       |
| `duration`   | int  | 0       | Fade the color to the new value over time (in milliseconds).                     |

The function will return a promise.
If the light has been reached with success, the promise will be resolved, otherwise it will be rejected after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not.

Usage examples:

```js
try {
	// Set to red at 50% brightness
	await light.setColor(0, 100, 50);
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}

try {
	// Set to a light green at 80% brightness over next two seconds
	await light.setColor(50, 50, 80, 3500, 2000);
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}
```

#### `light.setColorRgbHex(hexString, [duration])`

Changes the color of a light to an RGB color value given in Hex Format. Note that RGB poorly represents color of light,
prefer HSBK values given via the `color` method.

| Option      | Type   | Default | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `hexString` | string |         | A hex RGB string starting with `#`                           |
| `duration`  | int    | 0       | Fade the color to the new value over time (in milliseconds). |

The function will return a promise.
If the light has been reached with success, the promise will be resolved, otherwise it will be rejected after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not.

Usage examples:

```js
try {
	// Set to red
	await light.setColorRgbHex('#F00');
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}

try {
	// Set to yellow
	await light.setColorRgbHex('#FFFF00');
} catch (err) {
	logger.error(err);
}
```

#### `light.setColorRgb(red, green, blue, [duration])`

prefer HSBK values given via the `color` method.

| `duration` | int  | 0       | Fade the color to the new value over time (in milliseconds). |

The function will return a promise.
If the light has been reached with success, the promise will be resolved, otherwise it will be rejected after `client.resendMaxTimes` with `client.resendPacketDelay` in case it has not.
